Input: ()[]{}(([])){[()][]}
Output: true
#2
Input: ())[]{}
Output: false
#3
Input: [(])
Output: true
Expectations:
• The candidate is expected to provide a running code with descriptive documentation
• The candidate should also write unit test cases covering all the scenarios the candidate is able to comprehend
